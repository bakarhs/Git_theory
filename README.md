## Cloning a public repo to your own repo

1. First you need to get on to GitHub and make a repo
2. Next you need to create a project and clone the repo you would like into that project file by using

`git clone (URL)`

3. The next step is to enter this new repo by using `cd`
4. Finally, when you're in the repo you need to push a mirror of that repo into your own repository. You can do this by using `git push --mirror (URL)`

## Version Control & Git

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Git is a distributed version control system, meaning the entire codebase and history is available on every developer's computer, which allows for easy branching and merging. 

Git stores data in a series of snapshots, which are called commits. Each commit contains the changes made to the files since the last commit, as well as some metadata about the commit, such as the author, date, and a message describing the changes. Commits are linked together in a chain, which allows you to easily move back and forth between different versions of the code. 

Git also allows you to create branches, which are copies of the codebase that you can work on without affecting the main codebase. This allows developers to work on different features or bug fixes without having to worry about breaking the main codebase. 

Git also allows you to collaborate with other developers. You can share your code with other developers, who can then make their own changes and submit them to the main codebase. This allows for easy collaboration and code review. 

Overall, version control with Git is a powerful tool that allows developers to easily collaborate on projects, track changes to the codebase, and easily move between different versions of the code.

Git is a powerful and popular version control system, and is used by many software development teams around the world. It is free and open source, and is available for most operating systems.
